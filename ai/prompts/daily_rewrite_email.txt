You will analyze a daily log that includes:
- A TODO list for the day
- A free-form written summary
- A time summary

Your task is to produce a structured and meaningful interpretation of the day,
not a paraphrase.

Please generate the following sections:

1) Summary  
   Provide a clear and concise interpretation of the day’s major progress,
   decisions, and meaningful changes.

2) TODO Evaluation  
   For each TODO item, evaluate its completion status based on evidence found
   in the summary and time log. Use: Done / In Progress / Not Done.

3) Key Insights  
   Highlight significant patterns, lessons learned, surprises, or recurring issues.

4) Next Actions  
   Provide 3–5 prioritized, actionable items for the next day.

5) Risks / Bottlenecks  
   Point out any issues that may cause trouble soon, including repeated errors,
   uncertain dependencies, or fragile components.

Formatting requirements:
- Use short paragraphs and occasional bullet points.
- Output must be email-ready.
- Avoid headings with "#" and do not use Markdown-specific formatting.
- Do not invent information not present in the log.
