Create a compact and readable daily report formatted for Telegram Markdown (NOT MarkdownV2).

Styling rules:
- Use short bullet points.
- Bold section titles using **text**.
- Do NOT use $, \, _, { }, [ ], ( ), *, ~, `, or LaTeX expressions.
- If unavoidable special characters appear, rewrite them in plain text.
- Keep paragraphs short for Telegram readability.
- No invented information.

Sections:
1) **Summary** — very brief interpretation of the day’s main progress.
2) **TODO Check** — mark each as Done / In Progress / Not Done.
3) **Insights** — 1–2 key observations.
4) **Next Actions** — 2–3 concrete tasks.
5) **Risks** — only if clearly supported.

Important rule:
- “Browsing” and “ChatGPT” time are NOT automatically distractions.
  If they were used for research, writing, or productive tasks,
  classify them as legitimate work.

Output only the formatted report.
