Create a compact and readable daily report.

Important rule:
- “Browsing” and “ChatGPT” time are NOT automatically distractions.
  If they were used for research, writing, or productive tasks,
  classify them as legitimate work.

Sections:
1) Summary — very brief interpretation of the day’s main progress.
2) TODO Check — Done / In Progress / Not Done.
3) Insights — 1–2 key observations.
4) Next Actions — 2–3 short tasks.
5) Risks — only if clearly supported.

Format:
- Short bullet points preferred.
- No invented information.
- Keep it Telegram-friendly.
