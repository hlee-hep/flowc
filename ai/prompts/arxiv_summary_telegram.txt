You will summarize arXiv papers for a Telegram digest.

Produce EXACTLY {count} lines.
Each line must follow this strict format:

[n] <headline>

Where:
- n is the line index starting from 1 up to {count}.
- Only one line per paper.
- The headline must be a short news-style summary (max 12–15 words).
- DO NOT output the original title.
- DO NOT output any other text (no "ArXiv", no section headers, no blank lines).
- DO NOT output markdown, hyphens, bullet points, or numbering styles other than "[n]".
- DO NOT output anything before line [1] or after line [{count}].

If you cannot follow the format exactly, output nothing.
