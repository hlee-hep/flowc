Rewrite the daily log into a concise meaning-focused report.

Important rule:
- Do NOT assume that “Browsing” or “ChatGPT” time is unproductive.
  If the log shows they were used for research, technical exploration,
  writing, or analysis, treat them as productive work.

Sections:
1) Summary — 2–3 sentences describing the day’s main progress.
2) TODO Evaluation — For each item: Done / In Progress / Not Done.
3) Insights — 2–3 short observations directly supported by the log.
4) Next Actions — 2–3 concrete tasks for tomorrow.
5) Risks — Only list risks that are explicitly or implicitly supported.

Rules:
- No managerial tone.
- No redundant repetition.
- No invented information.
- Compact and clean for Notion.
