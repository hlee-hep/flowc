You will receive a daily log that contains:
- A TODO list for the day
- A user-written free-form summary
- A time summary

Your goal is NOT to rewrite the text but to interpret its meaning.

Perform the following tasks:

1) **Evaluate TODO Completion**
   - Compare each TODO item with the content in the summary and time log.
   - Mark each as: (Done) / (In Progress) / (Not Done).
   - If ambiguous, choose the most reasonable interpretation.

2) **Summary**
   - Provide a high-level interpretation of the day.
   - Focus on important progress, meaningful decisions, and notable changes.
   - Ignore trivial edits or repetitive details.

3) **Key Insights**
   - Identify patterns, lessons, or notable observations from the day.
   - Provide interpretation, not paraphrasing.

4) **Next Actions**
   - Suggest 2–5 concrete tasks for the next day.
   - Must be actionable and logically derived from the day’s work.

5) **Risks / Bottlenecks**
   - Identify potential blockers, repeated errors, fragile components,
     or tasks likely to cause issues soon.

Formatting rules:
- NO headings (#).
- You may use **bold**, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
- Keep the tone analytical and concise.
- Do NOT add information not supported by the log.
